Several scripts are available to ease the generation of server certificates so as to running client / server commands for testing purpose with gdb.

# run.sh

## run_server

This command bootstraps the malicious server.

```run.sh run_server```

1. Fetch OpenSSL 3.0.7 source code, statically compile it with debug symbols. It also adds CFLAGS to generate expand files, useful to generate call graph.
2. Build server certificate chains
3. start server with openssl binary compiled at step1.

## run_vuln_client

This command bootstraps the vulnerable client.

```run.sh run_vuln_client```

1. Fetch OpenSSL 3.0.6 source code, statically compile it with debug symbols. It also adds CFLAGS to generate expand files, useful to generate call graph.
2. start client gdb session with openssl binary compiled at step1. Gdb commands will:
  * set a breakpoint on the vulnerable function

## compile

```run.sh compile openssl-3.0.6```

Fetches OpenSSL source code based on provided version, statically compiles it with debug symbols. It also adds CFLAGS to generate expand files, useful to generate call graph.

## build_server

```run.sh build_server```

Rebuilds the server certificate chains. Useful if you updated the server configuration and just want to use the new certs.

## clean

```run.sh clean clean_server```

These commands will delete all files created at build step. You can clean globally by calling clean, or just for server with clean_server.
